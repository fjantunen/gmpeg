<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks, and my local library is a great source of audiobooks, however I try to avoid having to rip CDs like it was 1999.</p>



<p>Here in the Broward Library system there&#8217;s a few apps through which you can listen to audiobooks (and other content): <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.txtr.android.mmm&amp;hl=en_US">CloudLibrary</a> (via Nova) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hoopladigital.android&amp;hl=en_US">Hoopla</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overdrive.mobile.android.libby&amp;hl=en_US">Libby</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ocd&amp;hl=en_US">RBDigital</a>.</p>



<p>I rip them via <a href="https://www.syncios.com/audio-recorder-android/">Syncios Audio Recorder</a> which requires root and an older Android OS. Be sure to start the Audio Recorder app before you open then other apps otherwise recording will not work.</p>



<p>I then upload them to Google Drive, and sync them to another device I listen on. I can then listen (at my convenience) via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acmeandroid.listen">Listen Audiobook Player</a>. This is the best Audiobook app, as it supports equalizers and variable speed playback. </p>



<p>You will need a rooted device, and it has to support an older Android (4/5) for this method to work. I use a 2015 Fire Tablet from Amazon. You could probably use a <a href="https://amzn.to/2ALxJpH">newer version</a> as well, as Fire OS is pretty outdated. Sometimes you can pick them up for as low as $30 new. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-fire-7-5th-7th-gen-unlocked-rooted/">XDA has good information on how to root these devices</a>.</p>



<p>There are also some high quality TTS voices on the Fire 2015 from Ivona, a company Amazon bought a few years back that I couldn&#8217;t get to run on any other modern devices, another reason to use Fire tablets. If you pair this with a good TTS reader such as my favorite <a href="https://reedy-reader.com/">Reedy</a> you can get some awesome results. Reedy is no longer available in the play store, but if you look around you can find it. </p>



<p>Reedy also supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation">RSVP</a>, think about RVSP as technologically assisted speed reading. I prefer to read normally and use variable speed playback to <a href="http://jaems.jp/contents/icomej/vol11/06_Nagahama.pdf">enhance retention</a>.</p>



<p>Before trying this method I tried a legacy Android emulator made by American Megatrends called <a href="http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Android_emulators">Amiduos</a>. This for some reason does not support  <a href="https://www.syncios.com/audio-recorder-android/">Syncios Audio Recorder</a> properly. Also, development stopped on this emulator, but if you need an Android emulator, it&#8217;s the best and fastest one, if you can find it.</p>
