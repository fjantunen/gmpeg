<p>I wasn&#8217;t happy with the lag in most baby monitor apps out there in the Google Play store. I wanted something with less lag, so when my son moves around or wakes up, I can react more quickly.<br><br>Gamers know all about lag, and who better to turn to than to them. I settled on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_(software)">Mumble server</a>, which has since fallen out of favor due to the popularity of Discord. <br><br>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://sbcguides.com/install-mumble-server-on-raspberry-pi/">great guide</a> I used to set up a Mumble server on my Raspberry Pi. I also set one up on Entware, but those packages are outdated.<br><br>Mumble is very secure and using the Opus audio codec provides ultra low latency communication.<br><br>The best Android mumble client I could find is called <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/se.lublin.mumla/">Mumla</a>, and available via the 3rd party app store F-Droid. Clients also exist for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, iOS and Android, and Web.<br><br>I set the &#8220;transmitter&#8221; (baby side) to &#8220;Continuous&#8221; mode and set the &#8220;receiver&#8221; (parent side) as &#8220;push to talk&#8221;, in case I want to talk back to the &#8220;transmitter&#8221;. <br><br>This system also makes a great ip based home intercom system.<br><br>To add further automation to this I also set it to auto reconnect, if it loses connection, and I schedule the WiFi to turn off and on at night to minimize EMF exposure at night and maximize battery life.<br><br>I also added a video streaming app in the form of an app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam.pro&amp;hl=en_US">IPWebcam Pro</a> (which you can password protect).<br><br>I still run both apps on a low end phone as the transmitter, and disable the audio portion of IPWebcam. I cannot achieve the same level of low latency audio that I can with a mumble server/client solution, even with Opus selected.<br><br>IPWebcam does have the lowest latency available for video that I&#8217;ve seen. Using flash tends to offer (I know, I know&#8230; I hate flash too) the absolute lowest latency on the video side.</p>
